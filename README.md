# BioinfoPractice
This repository is for collecting basic examples and tutorials on Bioinformatics scripting in the SLURM system.
It is intended to be a collaborative effort within the Harpur Lab.

Currently, it contains tutorials on: 
- Basics of Unix commands and SLURM jobs
- Parallel processing using SLURM job arrays

Suggested tutorials could cover:
- Setting up terminal emulators, ssh forwarding, and FTP clients on local machines
- data management within scratch, data depot, and fortress 
- nucleotide allignment (nextflow)
- transcriptomics (BLAST and GO terms)
- population scale data (VCF format) 
- building tree sequences
